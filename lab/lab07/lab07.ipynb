    "# Lab 7: The Impact of Minimum Wage on Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to replicate a study conducted by **[Card and Krueger in 1994](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf)** that investigates the relationship between a rise in the minimum wage and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Economic theories](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2015/12/effects-of-minimum-wage-on-employment/) have long suggested that increases in the minimum wage lead to a reduction in employment for at least two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Businesses are less likely to hire** and will rather invest in other resources that are now cheaper because of the wage increase.\n",
    "2. **Higher salaries will induce businesses to raise their prices** to compensate for their greater costs; as prices increase, we expect fewer buyers, which will lead to lower demand and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These theories have found [mixed support](https://www.nber.org/papers/w12663), but the discussion is still very much open within the policy world, as states discuss the opportunity to raise their minimum wage to help local populations to face increasing living costs. Discussions are currently occurring in **[New Jersey](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/nj-minimum-wage.html)** and **[Illinois](https://kmox.radio.com/articles/discussions-underway-raise-illinois-minimum-wage-15hour)** to raise the minimum wage to **$15/hour** ([New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/nyregion/15-minimum-wage-new-york.html?module=inline) has successfully passed this same raise in 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Original Study\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first studies looking at this policy problem was **Card and Krueger’s**. They applied a difference-in-difference design to look at two groups of fast-food restaurants:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast-food restaurants in **New Jersey** where the minimum wage increased from \\\\$4.25 to $5.05 per hour (treatment group)\n",
    "- Fast-food restaurants in **Pennsylvania** where the minimum wage did not increase (control group).\n",
    "\n",
    "They collected data before and after the minimum wage was approved. Data used in the study can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DS4PS/PROG-EVAL-III/blob/master/TEXTBOOK/DATA/DID_Example.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do increases in the minimum wage affect employment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **An increase in the minimum wage is negatively correlated with employment.**\n"

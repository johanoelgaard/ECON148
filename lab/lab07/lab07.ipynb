    "# Lab 7: The Impact of Minimum Wage on Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to replicate a study conducted by **[Card and Krueger in 1994](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf)** that investigates the relationship between a rise in the minimum wage and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Economic theories](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2015/12/effects-of-minimum-wage-on-employment/) have long suggested that increases in the minimum wage lead to a reduction in employment for at least two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Businesses are less likely to hire** and will rather invest in other resources that are now cheaper because of the wage increase.\n",
    "2. **Higher salaries will induce businesses to raise their prices** to compensate for their greater costs; as prices increase, we expect fewer buyers, which will lead to lower demand and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These theories have found [mixed support](https://www.nber.org/papers/w12663), but the discussion is still very much open within the policy world, as states discuss the opportunity to raise their minimum wage to help local populations to face increasing living costs. Discussions are currently occurring in **[New Jersey](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/nj-minimum-wage.html)** and **[Illinois](https://kmox.radio.com/articles/discussions-underway-raise-illinois-minimum-wage-15hour)** to raise the minimum wage to **$15/hour** ([New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/nyregion/15-minimum-wage-new-york.html?module=inline) has successfully passed this same raise in 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Original Study\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first studies looking at this policy problem was **Card and Krueger’s**. They applied a difference-in-difference design to look at two groups of fast-food restaurants:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast-food restaurants in **New Jersey** where the minimum wage increased from \\$4.25 to \\$5.05 per hour (treatment group)\n",
    "- Fast-food restaurants in **Pennsylvania** where the minimum wage did not increase (control group).\n",
    "\n",
    "They collected data before and after the minimum wage was approved. Data used in the study can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DS4PS/PROG-EVAL-III/blob/master/TEXTBOOK/DATA/DID_Example.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do increases in the minimum wage affect employment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **An increase in the minimum wage is negatively correlated with employment.**\n"

    "**Question 1.1:** How does the choice of research design, specifically a difference-in-differences approach, influence the validity and reliability of conclusions drawn from empirical studies examining the impact of policy changes, such as minimum wage increases, on economic outcomes like employment? Hint: Think about the parallell trend assumption."

    "The choice of a DiD approach definitely improves the reliability of the conclusions of studies as long as the parallel trend assumption is correct. DiD models are very good at isolating the causal effects policies by mitigating the effects of confounding variables. \n",
    "However, as mentioned, it heavily relies on the parallel trend assumption, i.e., in the absence of intervention, the treatment and control group trends would have been parallel. In this study, we assume that the trend in employment in fast food chains in New Jersey and Pennsylvania would have been the same had New Jersey not increased the minimum wage. Thus, a thorough examination of the trend in the period leading up to it is essential to support this assumption."

Along with the **Group** and **Treatment** variables, we also include a set of control variables to account for differences across restaurants. For instance, we consider the variable **opening hours**—suggesting that fast-food restaurants open for more hours might need more employees. Similarly, we account for the prices of **fries and sodas**, under the assumption that more expensive fast food might have more resources to hire additional staff.\n"

    "    - _Treatment_: This captures any pre-existing differences in employment levels between the two groups before the policy change. As `Treatment = 1` means we are in New Jersey, a positive sign would mean that New Jersey has a higher employment than Pennsylvania in general and vice versa if it is negative. Thus, I do not have any specific expectations for this parameter's sign.\n",
    "    - _Post_: This term accounts for time trends affecting the treatment and control groups. `Post` is a binary indicator that equals `1` for the period after the policy change and `0` before. The coefficient thus captures general time effects on employment unrelated to the policy intervention. The US was coming out of the early 1990s recession, which could increase demand and thus employment, but at the same time, fast-food vendors might have improved efficiency, which could decrease employment. Thus, this sign could be positive or negative.\n",
    "    - _TreatmentxPost_: This is the interaction term and key to our analysis. The `Treatment_Post` variable is `1` for fast-food vendors in New Jersey after the policy intervention, i.e. after the increase in the minimum wage. Our hypothesis is that _An increase in the minimum wage is negatively correlated with employment_, and we expect this to be negative as employment should fall in New Jersey after the minimum wage increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actual Sign**:\n",
    "    - _Treatment_: Negative. Hence, stores in New Jersey generally had fewer employees than their Pennsylvania counterparts.\n",
    "    - _Post_: Negative. Thus, there is a decrease in the average employment over time for all of the vendors.\n",

    "- **Effect on Dependent Variable**:\n",
    "    - _Treatment_: If the vendor is in New Jersey, it, in general, has $2.847$ employees less than if it had been in Pennsylvania.\n",
    "    - _Post_: The average number of employees decreased to $2.6943$ employees between when the fast-food vendors were first surveyed and when they were last surveyed.\n",
    "    - _TreatmentxPost_: The employment at fast-food vendors in New Jersey increased by $3.5708$ compared to Pennsylvania after adopting the new minimum wage.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Economic Significance**: \n",
    "    - The results suggest that though New Jersey adopted a higher minimum wage, they increased the average number of employees by $-2.6943+3.5708 = 0.8765$ (`Post`+`Treatment_Post`). Further, we also see that the average employment in the two states is getting closer to each other as vendors in Pennsylvania decrease their average employment while New Jersey increases it. This could indicate that there might be some regression towards a mean – Pennsylvania might just be higher before and New Jersey lower. The net-effects post is just a regression towards an ideal employment level. Additionally, I see a very low $R^2$ value, of just $1.1\\%$, which indicates that our analysis only explains a small part of the variation."
